# Fabrials UI film

64 seconds · 1920×1080 · 30 fps · H.264 + stereo AAC.

React elements, SVG, frame-driven motion, spring entrances and Remotion transitions illustrate manual controls, a labeled simulated tool call, experimental native WebMCP, remote MCP and installation. Live behavior is covered by separate browser/protocol checks.

All Remotion packages are pinned to **4.0.521**, the latest release verified at production. English narration uses Grok voice **eve** through **https://ai.fabrials.com/v1/tts**. The instrumental bed is an original deterministic synthesizer composition. No stock music or screenshots are used.

## Reproduce

Use Bun 1.4.2, Node 22+, FFmpeg and an actual Chrome executable.

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
# Supply AI_RELAY_VIRTUAL_KEY securely through the environment.
bun run video:voice
bun run video:music
CHROME_BIN=/path/to/chrome bun run video:render
bun run video:studio
```

Voice requests are fingerprint-cached under ignored artifacts/remotion-public/. Narration generation updates video/remotion/timing.json; scene lengths follow actual audio durations. Rendering copies the bundled font, regenerates sentence captions, and writes MP4/poster/VTT to artifacts/remotion-film/. Captions use approximate sentence timing within each independently synthesized clip. PREVIEW_FRAMES=90,510,810,1100,1500,1800 renders review frames.

The composition mixes voice with a quiet instrumental bed and fades the music at the boundaries. The player requires a click, exposes audio controls, offers captions and includes the full transcript.

## Publish

bun run video:publish uses runtime S3_* credentials, PUTs and HEAD-verifies the public assets in bucket apps, prefix videos/fabrials-ui/v2/. PUBLISH_SOURCES=1 also preserves generated narration and score under source/; these are not exposed by the public media route.

Preserve Content-Encoding: identity and Cache-Control: no-transform so proxies retain media lengths and seeking. Bump both prefix and player version when replacing a published film.
